## 👨🏼‍💻 Angular CLI
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.9.

### 🏃🏼‍♂️ Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### 🚀 Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## 🎨 UI
This project uses [Spartan ng](https://www.spartan.ng/) and Tailwind CSS for UI. This is due to the fact that I had to write this Project during a holiday camp.
Those primitives helped me to speed up the dev process by a lot.


## ⚠️ Disclaimer
Due to the limited time I had to write this project, it is not as polished as I would like it to be.
Many of the feature are plain and barebone, but they work. If you would like to know what I would have done differently, please reach out to me.
